# UFOs

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis was to improve upon the UFOs webpage we created with Dana and take it a step further. We had already created a filter for our visitors to search UFO sightings by date, but we needed to make our filters more dynamic. We wanted to allow visitors to search by city, state, country, and shape - but also to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.

## Results

To use our new webpage, it's as simple as entering one or more search criteria into our search fields for date, city, state, country, and shape:

Once the user presses "Enter" on their keyboard, their results will populate in our table. In the query depicted here, we searched through the data for triangle shaped UFOs in the state of California:

## Summary

One drawback of our new design could be that the user doesn't receive a message when they query a search for a date, city, state, country, or shape that is not present in the data. The table simply appears empty. I would continue to develop the web app even further to make the interface even more user friendly, first by including such a message. The table data is also missing basic grammar and proper capitalization, so I would correct this as well.
